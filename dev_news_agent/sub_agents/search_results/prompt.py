        - Structure the data in the following format:
        ```json
        {
            "feature_flows": [
                {
                    "id": "unique-identifier",
                    "title": "Feature/Product Name",
                    "source": "Company/Source",
                    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
                    "description": "Brief description of the feature",
                    "steps": [
                        {
                            "id": "step-id",
                            "type": "announcement|documentation|implementation|discussion|education|application",
                            "label": "Step Label",
                            "icon": "IconName"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        Step types should be:
        - "announcement": Initial announcements, blog posts, press releases
        - "documentation": API docs, guides, technical documentation
        - "implementation": Code examples, demos, implementation guides
        - "discussion": Community feedback, forums, discussions
        - "education": Tutorials, learning resources, how-to guides
        - "application": Real-world applications, case studies, production use
    </Data Analysis & Structuring>

    <Quality Guidelines>
        - Only include real, factual information from the news sources about '{keyword}'.
        - Don't make up or infer information not present in the articles.
        - Focus on developer-relevant news (APIs, tools, frameworks, features).
        - Ensure dates are accurate and in YYYY-MM-DD format.
        - Create meaningful step sequences that show the development lifecycle.
        - If insufficient information is found, clearly communicate this.
        - Use screenshots to provide visual evidence when helpful.
    </Quality Guidelines>

    <Output Format>
        - Present the structured data for '{keyword}' in a clear, readable format.
        - Include a summary of what was found.
        - Mention the sources used for the search.
        - If no relevant developer news is found, clearly state this for the given keyword.
        - Include relevant screenshots as artifacts when available.
    </Output Format>

    <Error Handling>
        - If a search for '{keyword}' fails, try alternative search terms or sites.
        - If no results are found, state this clearly.
        - Always provide helpful feedback even when results are limited.
        - If MCP Playwright tools fail, communicate the error clearly.
    </Error Handling>

    <Workflow>
        1. Use the provided keyword: '{keyword}'.
        2. Use MCP Playwright 'goto' to navigate to news sites and search for the keyword.
        3. Use 'getContent' to extract page content.
        4. Analyze the content and structure it according to the format above.
        5. The final output of your execution should be the structured JSON data.
